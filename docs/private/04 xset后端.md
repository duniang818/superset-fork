DRY: dont repeat yourself
The main goal for this project is to provide a simple development framework that handles the main problems any web application or site encounters. It will help you adhere to the DRY (Don’t repeat yourself) principle.
This framework goes further than an admin scaffolding package.这个框架比管理脚手架包更进一步
skeleton application = scaffold application

- [ ] There are two type of skeletons available you can choose from SQLAlchemy default or MongoEngine for MongoDB. **To use the MongoEngine skeleton you need to install flask-mongoengine extension.** 📅 2024-05-29
